# Bayou Theme for Micro.blog
![Bayou Theme for Micro.blog Logo](https://github.com/MattSLangford/Bayou-Theme/blob/main/bayou.png?raw=true)

### Description
Bayou Theme is developed for use with the Micro.blog platform. It is designed to be as fast as possible while still supporting all features of the platform and popular plugins. Unlike other themes, it breaks apart microposts and longform content from each other. A single micropost is shown on the homepage along side of 10 (or more) longform posts. This theme requires the use of special categories.

**Demo and Docs**: bayou.micro.blog

### Credits
Bayou Theme is created and maintained by [Matt Langford](http://micro.blog/mtt?remote_follow=1) (follow on Micro.blog).

### Do You Value This Theme?
Bayou Theme and its plugins are provided free of charge to Micro.blog users. I do not receive payment from Micro.blog in any way. If you'd like to help offset expenses and ensure the future of Tiny Theme and its plugins, please consider supporting its development.
