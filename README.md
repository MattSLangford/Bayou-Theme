# Bayou Theme for Micro.blog
![Bayou Theme for Micro.blog Logo](https://github.com/MattSLangford/Bayou-Theme/blob/main/bayou.png?raw=true)

### Description
Bayou Theme is developed for use with the Micro.blog platform. It is designed to be as fast as possible while still supporting all features of the platform and popular plugins. Unlike other themes, it breaks apart microposts and longform content from each other. A single micropost is shown on the homepage along side of 10 (or more) longform posts. This theme requires the use of special categories.

**Demo and Docs**: bayou.micro.blog
